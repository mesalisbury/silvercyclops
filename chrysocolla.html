<h>I wanted to show off a close up of this piece of chrysocolla before it gets set into the pendant I made. I have always been drawn to blue and green gems so I have been obsessed with this stone since it's been on my work bench. The blue/green color variations naturally form when copper is present during the formation of chrysocolla. The matrix of the host stone provides a contrast that leaves thin veins of color growing throughout the stone that really highlight all the intricate details. This is a beautiful and unique piece of the earth. Finished product to be posted this week along with two matching chrysocolla rings with custom sizing available for a matching set</h>
