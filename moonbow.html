Kentucky is home to a waterfall that is one of the rare places that creates a moonbow on a regular basis. For a lunar rainbow to exist, specific criteria must be met. The water in the air, the night sky free of cloud cover, the amount and angle of light coming from the moon: Nature's recipe for a nighttime lightshow. One of the best places in the world to witness this phenomenon is in Cumberland Falls, Kentucky. 
Over the years I have made a few visits to this location. The waterfall is immense and powerful. You will hear the crashing water before you are able to lay eyes on it. Standing at the foot of the waterfall, the audio alone will demand your attention and hold it. It is a beautiful place to be. 
The bank of the river surrounding the falls is heavily spotted with coal. While coal is not a rare sight here in Kentucky, it was interesting to me to see coal that was smooth and rounded, polished by time in the river. A sharp contrast to the jagged edges found on rocks broken by explosives and dug from the insides of mountains. I began to conceptualize the Moonbow Collection while watching my kids play with these stones. 
I have borrowed elements from this experience and put them into metal. In this collection you will find the smooth river coal set in sterling silver, embellished with silver moons and rainbow moonstone gems.

*NOTE*
Coal is not traditionally used in jewelry making due to its durability. The coal used in my jewelry has been stabilized and sealed to prevent any damage from normal wear and tear.

Stones that spend time in a river go through a natural tumbling process. Water pushing them downstream and against one another will create rounded edges and a smooth surface. The coal used in the Moonbow Collection have gone through this natural process. Time spent in the Cumberland river has transported and transformed the handful of coal seen in this picture.

As I was preparing the coal to be set down in silver I did not have to do much shaping outside of flattening the back sides. I liked the idea of preseving the stones as I found them. Shined up and pretty. But still simple and free form, like a small stone you might find laying on the bed of a river. Which is what they are.
